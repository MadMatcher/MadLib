## How to Install MadLib on a Single Machine

You can install and run MadLib on a single machine. If you have relatively small tables, or just want to experiment with MadLib, this is often sufficient. Otherwise you may consider installing and running MadLib on [a cluster of machines](./install-cloud-based-cluster.md) (such as on Amazon Web Services). 

If you are using MadLib with Pandas on the single machine setting in Linux, see this guide [Installing on Linux](./install-linux-single-machine.md).

If you are using MadLib with Spark on the single machine setting in Linux, see this guide [Installing on Linux](./install-linux-single-machine.md).

If you are using MadLib with Pandas on the single machine setting on MacOS, see this guide [Installing on MacOS](./install-macOS-single-machine.md).

If you are using MadLib with Spark on the single machine setting on MacOS, see this guide [Installing on MacOS](./install-macOS-single-machine.md).
