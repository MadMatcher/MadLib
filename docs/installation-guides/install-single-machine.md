## How to Install MatchFlow on a Single Machine

You can install and run MatchFlow on a single machine. If you have relatively small tables, or just want to experiment with MatchFlow, this is often sufficient. Otherwise you may consider installing and running MatchFlow on [a cluster of machines](./install-cloud-based-cluster.md) (such as on Amazon Web Services).

We currently offer the following ways to install MatchFlow on a single machine. _Once installed, MatchFlow can be run using Pandas or Spark (on a single machine)._
